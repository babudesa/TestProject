    be able to see it after the commit. This forward will take them to the loss details again if they can still see
    the claim, otherwise it backs off to the special "cannot view claim" page. Note that ForwardCondition automatically
    checks if the user has permission to visit its destination, and the condition is skipped if the user doesn't have
