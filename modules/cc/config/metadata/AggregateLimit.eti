    Defines an annual or lifetime limit on an insurer's liability. This entity's LimitAmount value defines
    the maximum amount that an insurer is required to pay for a specific period. Each CoverageLine, which represents either a
    CoverageType or a specific Coverage, has an associated AggregateLimit and they are linked together through the CoverageLineLimit
    entity. The AggregateLimit.CoverageLines array contains the lines that reference a particular AggregateLimit. Each AggregateLimit
    is associated with a single policy period and zero or more coverage lines. If associated with multiple coverage lines, all the 
    lines must be unique.
