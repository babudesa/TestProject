      <div class="zGlossary_Element"><a name="1051814">R</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051815">rate</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067176">The cost of a unit of insurance, usually per $1,000. Rates are based on historical loss experience for similar risks and may be </a>regulated by state insurance offices.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067195">rated policy</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067214">An insurance policy that is classified as having a greater-than-average likelihood of loss. It usually is issued with special </a>exclusions, a premium rate that is higher than the rate for a standard policy, a reduced face amount, or any combination of these.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121335">rating</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1121336">In PolicyCenter, the process of determining base pricing for an insurance application. It can also be the revised pricing for a </a>policy after certain changes, such as adding coverage, reducing coverage, changing deductibles, or any other changes.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121333">rating agencies</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067220">Six major credit agencies determine insurers’ financial strength and viability to meet claims obligations. They are A.M. Best </a>Co.; Duff and Phelps Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; Moody’s Investors Services; Standard and Poor’s Corp.; and Weiss Ratings, Inc. Factors considered include company earnings, capital adequacy, operating leverage, liquidity, investment performance, reinsurance programs, and management ability, integrity and experience. A high financial rating is not the same as a high consumer satisfaction rating. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051817">reciprocity</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069337">The practice in which reinsurances are placed one against another. This is so that a reinsured only places a share of its business </a>with reinsurers who are willing to provide shares in their own treaties. This produces an equivalent volume of premium income. Reciprocity is normally confined to fire proportional business and is occasionally based on an equivalent profit exchange rather than premium income. This is no longer practised in Australia or New Zealand. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069336">recovery</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051818">A general term that refers to all forms of recouping some of the indemnity payments made on a claim, this can mean salvage </a>and subrogation. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051822">reference type (refType)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051823">A field in web service APIs that allows API client code to reference an </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">existing</span> object in the database instead of creating a new object. Sometimes, you want to add a new data object that references a previously added object. If an object is already in the database and you know its public ID, then set the public ID for the object. Call the object’s <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">setRefType</span> method and pass it the reference type enumeration value <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">RefTypeEnum.GW_ByRef</span>.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1122049">reinstatement</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1122050">The process by which an insurer puts back into force an insurance policy that has been terminated. Reasons for termination can </a>include for nonpayment of premiums. It is one of the jobs in PolicyCenter. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067238">reinsurance</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067251">Insurance bought by insurers. A reinsurer assumes part of the risk and part of the premium originally taken by the insurer, </a>known as the primary company. Reinsurance effectively increases an insurer's capital and therefore its capacity to sell more coverage. The business is global and some of the largest reinsurers are based abroad. Reinsurers have their own reinsurers, called <span class="e_-_emphasis">retrocessionaires</span>. Reinsurers do not pay policyholder claims. Instead, they reimburse insurers for claims paid. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067261">renewals</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069343">The extension of the term of coverage of an expired policy, commonly by replacement with another policy effective on the </a>date of expiration of the previous policy. It is one of the jobs in PolicyCenter. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069342">renewal processing</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068195">The process of renewing a policy. The goal is to: 1.) Minimize losses through the elimination of policyholders with losses </a>exceeding premiums. 2.) Maximize retention of a carrier’s best customers. 3.) Reduce expenses associated with the renewal process. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068185">renters insurance</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067265">A form of insurance that covers a policyholder’s belongings against perils such as fire, theft, windstorm, hail, explosion, van</a>dalism, riots, and others. It provides personal liability coverage for damage the policyholder or dependents cause to third parties. It also provides additional living expenses, known as loss-of-use coverage, if a policyholder must move while the dwelling is repaired. It also can include coverage for property improvements. Possessions can be covered for their replacement cost or the actual cash value that includes depreciation.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051826">rescission</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068514">The cancellation or undoing of a contract and restoration of the parties to the position they occupied before the contract. A </a>party may ordinarily rescind a contract in cases of fraud, misrepresentation or duress by the other party and, in some cases, where a breach renders the contract worthless.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068513">reserves</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051827">A company’s best estimate of what it will pay for claims. State regulations require insurance companies to err on the side of </a>solvency. They also require them to be conservative in recording expected liabilities for claims that have been reported including claims that are not yet known but are statistically predicted. In ClaimCenter, these reserves are set for a specific exposure in order to estimate probable future payments.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051828">refType</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051829">See </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">reference type</span>.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051834">retention</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067354">The amount of risk retained by an insurance company that is not reinsured.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067350">revisioning</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069539">How PolicyCenter tracks changes to a graph of objects in a policy through time (both model time and effective time). See: </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">model time</span> and <span class="e_-_emphasis">effective time</span>.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069538">rewrite job</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1121396">Policies are rewritten to make the types of changes that cannot be done in a policy change job, to correct significant errors, or </a>to make changes to the policy. A rewrite, which can only occur on a canceled policy, effectively ends the first policy and creates a new one in its place. For example, a customer requests a workers’ compensation policy. However, when the customer receives the policy, he notices many errors: the dates and payroll amounts are incorrect, and the building and location are in the wrong state. The customer notifies you, the agent. If you choose to fix the errors using a policy change job, the system would send out an addendum, calling out the mistakes in the policy. But because there are so many mistakes in the policy, you decide to rewrite the policy which sends out completely new policy documentation.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068224">rider</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067367">An attachment to an insurance policy that alters the policy’s coverage or terms. Sometimes known as an </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">endorsement</span>.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067363">risk</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069353">Risk is uncertainty concerning loss. Sometimes, companies also use this term to refer to a piece of business or a submission to </a>an insurer. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069352">risk analysis</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069359">A systematic use of available information to determine how often specified events may occur and the magnitude of their con</a>sequences.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069358">risk assessment</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069368">The overall process of risk analysis and risk evaluation. </a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069367">risk evaluation</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069374">The process used to determine risk management priorities by comparing the level of risk against predetermined standards, tar</a>get risk levels, or other criteria. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069373">risk management</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069380">The culture, processes, and structures that are directed towards the effective management of potential opportunities and </a>adverse effects.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069379">risk reservation</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051835">In the PolicyCenter default configuration, </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">risk reservation</span> is the process of associating a product and period to a specific producer code. If a producer code risk-reserves a product to which you do not have access, then PolicyCenter displays the product status on the <span class="ui_-_UI_element">New Submission</span> screen as <span class="e_-_emphasis">Risk Reserved</span>. In addition, PolicyCenter does not permit you to create new submissions for that product. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051836">RoL</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069386">Rate on Line</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069385">root object</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051837">Root objects are the main objects to be read or updated by an API. The term root object describes the types of objects (</a><span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Claim</span>, <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">User</span>). The term is sometimes informally applied to the symbol that refers to a root object available to a Gosu template.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051838">rule</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051839">A </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">rule</span> is the short name for a <span class="e_-_emphasis">business rule</span> written in Gosu and created within the Guidewire Studio application. It is a single decision in the following form: if {some conditions} then {take some action}</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1052689">rule engine</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1052690">This is the part of the Guidewire application server that evaluates Gosu rules when the system is running. It uses the rules and </a>rule sets created and edited within Guidewire Studio to make automated decisions. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051842">rule set</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067326">A rule set is a Guidewire application’s way of combining many individual rules into a useful set to consider as a group. For </a>example, in ClaimCenter, the Claim Segmentation rules set contains all of the individual decisions (rules) that determine how to categorize a claim. ClaimCenter uses rules by taking some item (in this case, a claim) and running the Claim Segmentation rules set against it to make one or more decisions. At various points, each Guidewire application runs different rule sets to make decisions. </div>
