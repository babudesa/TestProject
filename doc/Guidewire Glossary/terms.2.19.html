      <div class="zGlossary_Element"><a name="1067329">S</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051846">safe order</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1122153">See </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">safe-ordered messaging</span>. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1065721">safe-ordered messages</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211570">Safe ordering is a messaging feature in ClaimCenter and PolicyCenter. </a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211749">In ClaimCenter, messages associated with a </a><span class="s_-_strong">claim</span> always send ordered by claim for each messaging destination. These are <span class="e_-_emphasis">safe-ordered </span>messages. No more than one claim-related message is in flight for each messaging destination. There are other types of messages, such as <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Catastrophe</span> that are <span class="e_-_emphasis">non-safe-ordered</span> messages. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211756">In PolicyCenter, messages associated with a </a><span class="s_-_strong">account</span> always send ordered by account for each messaging destination. These are <span class="e_-_emphasis">safe-ordered </span>messages. No more than one account-related message is in flight for each messaging destination. There are are other types of messages unassociated with an account that are <span class="e_-_emphasis">non-safe-ordered</span> messages. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211775">BillingCenter does not need and thus does not use safe-ordered messaging. Effectively all BillingCenter messages are </a>non-safe-ordered messages. BillingCenter sends the messages in order but does not wait for acknowledgements before sending the next message for that destination.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211815">Although each messaging destination has its own sender thread on the batch server, within each destination multi-threaded </a>sending only applies to safe-ordered messages. As a consequence, the <span class="ui_-_UI_element">Number Sender Threads</span> configuration feature in messaging destination configuration applies only to safe-ordered messages in ClaimCenter and PolicyCenter, and never applies to BillingCenter.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051850">salvage</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067382">Damaged property an insurer takes over to reduce its loss after paying a claim. Insurers receive salvage rights over property on </a>which they have paid claims, such as badly-damaged cars. Insurers that paid claims on cargoes lost at sea now have the right to recover sunken treasures. Salvage charges are the costs associated with recovering that property.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051852">schedule</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067397">A list of individual items or groups of items that are covered under one policy or a listing of specific benefits, charges, credits, </a>assets or other defined items.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067393">self insurance</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067410">The concept of assuming a financial risk oneself, instead of paying an insurance company to take it on. Every policyholder is a </a>self-insurer in terms of paying a deductible and co-payments. Large firms often self-insure frequent, small losses such as damage to their fleet of vehicles or minor workplace injuries. However, to protect injured employees, state laws set out requirements for the assumption of workers compensation programs. Self-insurance also refers to employers who assume all or part of the responsibility for paying the health insurance claims of their employees. Firms that self insure for health claims are exempt from state insurance laws mandating the illnesses that group health insurers must cover. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067406">slice mode</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1071636">Viewing a </a><span class="cv_-_computer_voice">PolicyPeriod</span> entity’s subobjects at a specific effective date; hiding entities that are not effective at that date.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1071633">snapshot</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113032">In ClaimCenter, a saved duplicate of a claim taken at the time it was added to ClaimCenter. In BillingCenter, a point-in-time </a>view of the state of an agency bill invoice item.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1113033">SOAP protocol</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113034">The web services “request and response” protocol based on XML and typically implemented across the HTTP protocol. SOAP </a>supports remote APIs in a platform-neutral and language-neutral way. Guidewire applications make extensive use of SOAP in its native web services features. For more information, refer to the World Wide Web Consortium at <span class="cv_-_computer_voice"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap" target="external_window">http://www.w3.org/TR/soap</a></span>. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068525">split billing</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068526">A method to create a set of two or more receivables associated with a single transaction. For example, binding a workers’ com</a>pensation policy is a single transaction, but it might insure multiple locations. Further, the insured might want each location to be invoiced separately. This requires that the billing system split the total amount due into several invoices, each of which is to be tracked separately. Split billing does not relieve the main account holder from responsibility that the account remains in good standing. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051858">SSL</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051859">Secure Sockets Layer, a specific type of encryption of a data stream. SSL is commonly used to encrypt HTTP connections, </a>which are then referred to as HTTPS connections (and HTTPS URLs begin with “<span class="cv_-_computer_voice">https://</span>”).</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051860">staging table</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051861">A database table used temporarily to prepare data to import into an application’s database. Each application provides a </a>table-based import interface for very high volume data import. Staging table import is typically used for large-scale data conversion. Used in ClaimCenter and BillingCenter.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1070441">statement bill</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1070443">A statement produced by BillingCenter for each producer when an agency bill relationship exists between the carrier and the </a>producer. The monthly statement provides details of how much the producer expects to pay the carrier for income generated from a set of agency bill polices associated with the producer. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067955">stop loss</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069402">A provision in an insurance policy that cuts off an insurer’s losses at a given point. In effect, a stop loss agreement guarantees </a>the loss ratio of the insurer. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069401">Studio</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067953">The Guidewire administration tool for writing and managing rule sets, custom libraries, and Gosu classes. Guidewire Studio is </a>a Java-based graphical interface and a development environment. Use it to create and manage application resources including Gosu rules and classes, PCF pages, workflows, entity names, display keys, plugins and message destinations, and SOAP web services.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067959">subrogation</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067449">The legal process by which an insurance company, after paying a loss, seeks to recover the amount of the loss from another </a>party who is legally liable for it. For example, the carrier pays for repairs for a policyholder's car. It then tries to collect these costs from the insurance company of another person who was at fault in the accident. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212971">suspense item</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212999">That part of a payment that is reserved for a specific policy before BillingCenter receives the policy details or the related </a>charge.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212978">suspense payment</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213064">A payment that is recorded in BillingCenter for an account or policy that does not yet exist in BillingCenter. </a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051868">system-of-record (SOR)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051869">Particularly used in the context of PolicyCenter, this term indicates which system contains the authoritative copy of a record. </a>This can be either PolicyCenter or an external system that the application interfaces with. For example, if PolicyCenter is the system of record for a policy revision, then it has the authoritative copy. If PolicyCenter is not SOR, then it can have a copy of it, but assumes another system has the authoritative copy. This can be slightly different for various technical or business logic reasons. If it is <span class="e_-_emphasis">not</span> the SOR during a specific time period for a policy, PolicyCenter checks with the external policy administration system to get the most recent policy data. </div>
