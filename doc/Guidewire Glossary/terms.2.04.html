      <div class="zGlossary_Element"><a name="1051596">C</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051597">cancellation job</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068337">The termination of an in-force insurance contract by either the insured or the insurer. Termination may be voluntary, involun</a>tary, or mutual in accordance with provisions contained in the contract.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1211092">carrier</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211099">The insurance company that provides the policy to the insured.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1211109">carry forward (exception)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211116">A way to resolve an agency bill exception by stating that the amount in question will be paid in the next billing cycle.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068336">casualty</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051598">Refers to losses to property, bodily injuries, or other losses caused by an accident.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051599">catastrophe</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051600">Term used for statistical recording purposes. It refers to a single incident or a series of closely related incidents causing severe </a>insured property losses totaling more than a given amount, for example, $25 million. It describes an event (such as earthquake, storm, or flood) that causes many losses that can all be linked to the same broader cause. Carriers need to track claims related to catastrophes for reporting (internal and regulatory) and to collect on catastrophe reinsurance. Carriers also frequently assign special teams to handle the huge number of simultaneous claims in an expedited manner.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051601">cause of loss</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051602">Categorizes the reason for loss. Some common examples are collision for vehicles, theft, or natural causes like hail, wind, </a>earthquake, and flooding. Some companies also call these categories <span class="e_-_emphasis">perils</span>.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069953">charge</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212389">The fundamental invoicing unit that the policy administration system sends to BillingCenter in a billing instruction. A billing </a>instruction must contain at least one charge. BillingCenter then translates each charge into invoice items on an invoice or statement. Each charge includes the amount to be invoiced and a description.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212417">charge date</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212409">The date BillingCenter receives the billing instruction that contains the charge. The charge date can influence how </a>BillingCenter places invoice items on invoices.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212390">charge effective date</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212523">The date the coverage or coverage reduction specified by the charge takes effect. The charge effective date depends on the type </a>of billing instruction. For a new policy, the charge effective date is the same as the policy period's effective date. For an existing policy, it is the same as the effective date of a billing instruction for an existing policy (such as a policy change or a cancellation). The charge date can influence how BillingCenter places invoice items on invoices.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212391">charge hold</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1070153">A mechanism that prevents BillingCenter from continuing to bill the insured for any disputed amounts. A charge hold also pre</a>vents BillingCenter from charging late fees and from applying a delinquency to the account while there is an active dispute investigation in process.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212584">charge invoicing</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212585">The process in BillingCenter of dividing charges into invoice items and assigning the items to invoices in an invoice stream.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212587">charge pattern</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069958">A template for a charge that determines how BillingCenter handles the charge in terms of invoicing. For example, the Pre</a>mium charge pattern specifies an invoicing approach of <span class="e_-_emphasis">Down Payment and Installments</span> whereas the Taxes charge pattern specifies an invoicing approach of <span class="e_-_emphasis">One-time charge</span>. BillingCenter associates each charge with a single charge pattern. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1211178">charge pattern categories</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211185">Categories include: General, Premium, Fee, Tax, and Recapture.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069959">charge reversal</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069960">A type of transaction in BillingCenter that reverses charges made in error instead of reversing an amount that cannot be col</a>lected. In this way, they relate somewhat to write-offs.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068584">claim</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113391">A general term referring to all the different losses that arise from a single incident and a single policy. It is possible that a sin</a>gle incident (a flood, for example) can affect many policyholders leading to many claims. However, all damages to a particular policyholder for the actual flooding event (injuries, damages to a building, lost or damaged furnishings, for example) fall under the same claim. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body" style="color: #000000; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="e_-_emphasis"><a name="1113361">ClaimCenter and PolicyCenter use a different data model structure for a claim.</a></span></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121435">claim suffix</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1121436">The claim may include a suffix to reference a discrete piece of a claim or a specific exposure with a single type of loss. This </a>term is sometimes used because these separate claimant/loss issues are frequently identified in old legacy claims systems with a letter suffix such as 0034563<span class="s_-_strong">B</span>. This can indicate claim number 0034563 with suffix B for the second issue or “line” of the claim.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051605">claimant</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051606">This refers to a person involved in a claim who requests compensation for a loss. This often refers to third parties who make </a>liability claims against the policyholder. However, it can also indicate the policyholder in first party loss claims. As it is possible to incur multiple types of losses from a single incident, it is possible to have multiple claimants for a single claim. However, an exposure can have only one set of claimants, either first party or third party, but not both.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051607">class code</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069945">A code that identifies the type of risk. In workers’ comp, it is a four digit code that identifies the activities of the business, or </a>more precisely its employees. In commercial auto, the class code describes the type of vehicle, its use and range of use. In general liability, the class code describes the type of business activities being insured. In the context of statistical reporting, it is a subset of the possible stat codes. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069946">collateral</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1213300">An additional asset or amount that the carrier requires of an insured to secure coverage for a new or renewed policy. The </a>insured can satisfy the collateral requirement with cash, letters of credit (LOC), or a combination of both. The collateral deposit is subject to seizure in the event of delinquency.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1213301">collection agency</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1070282">A third-party organization that a carrier uses to collect unpaid funds. If an account becomes delinquent, an event in the delin</a>quency process can trigger the assignment of a collection agency as the payer of past due invoices. In BillingCenter, a collection agency is an account type.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121248">collision</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1121249">Coverage for losses to the insured’s vehicle due to an accident, such as hitting another vehicle, a tree, or an animal.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121246">commercial package policy (CPP)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067636">A single product that typically consists of two or more policy lines packaged together as a single policy. Included lines of busi</a>ness can be: commercial, general liability, commercial property, commercial auto, crime, boiler and machinery, and inland marine. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067614">commission</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068343">A portion of the policy premium (a percent) that is paid to a producer or insurance salesperson. The percentage varies widely </a>depending on coverage, the insurer, and the marketing. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069709">commission plan</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069710">A set of rules and attributes that determine the amount of commission paid to a producer (or producers) after the producer sells </a>a new policy or renews an existing policy.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051609">command</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051610">The basic building block of the interface-level integration framework for a Guidewire application. A command expresses an </a>action to perform anytime that you do something in the ClaimCenter interface. For example, a command can open a browser window and take you to another (related) web application.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051611">command shell</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051612">The context in which the services operate, giving the services the ability to discover and call each other. As part of initializa</a>tion, the command shell starts each service, giving the service a reference to the shell and letting services get references to each other.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1066222">commercial lines</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067115">Products designed for and bought by businesses. Among the major coverages are boiler and machinery, business income, com</a>mercial auto, comprehensive general liability, directors and officers liability, fire and allied lines. These can also include inland marine, medical malpractice liability, product liability, professional liability, surety and fidelity, and workers’ compensation. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113468">You can purchase most of these commercial coverages separately except business income, which you can only add to a fire </a>insurance (property) policy.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069871">comprehensive</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069872">Coverage for all other vehicle damage and contents, such as fire, theft, hail, vandalism, and so on.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069876">contacts</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069877">Details of the contact information for an account. Each account must have a primary contact. The primary contact is either a </a>business entity (company) or an individual associated with the account. ClaimCenter stores contact information within the application itself.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069873">contractual period</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1071524">A single policy term from the date the policy goes into effect (the </a><span class="e_-_emphasis"><a href="javascript:WWHClickedPopup('glossary', 'terms.2.06.html#1066309', '');" title="E">effective date</a></span>) to the date it expires (the <span class="e_-_emphasis">expiration date</span>). Generally speaking, a policy cannot have contractual periods that overlap in effective time. However, in some cases, it is possible for the contractual periods in a policy to overlap due to a policy cancellation or modification.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1071521">coverable</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069652">A coverable is an </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">exposure</span> to risk. (The intent of a policy is to mitigate that risk.) A coverable is a tangible property item, a location, a jurisdiction, or the policy itself. Within PolicyCenter, Guidewire makes the policy line a coverable to represent the named insureds. PolicyCenter attaches coverages <span class="e_-_emphasis">only</span> to coverables.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069651">coverage</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051616">A coverage is </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">protection</span> from a specific risk. PolicyCenter always attaches coverages to a coverable. There are two types of coverages: <span class="e_-_emphasis">property</span> and <span class="e_-_emphasis">liability</span>. To illustrate, on an automobile policy, a collision property coverage protects the insured's vehicle and a liability coverage protects the driver for damage done to another vehicle.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051617">coverage period</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051618">A carrier generally provides insurance against losses that occur during a specified period, regardless of the time that you dis</a>cover or report the loss. For liability coverages, this usually takes the form of providing coverage based on the date of the actual harm. It can also take the form of coverage based on the date in which the claim is made against the insured. Coverage based on the date of the actual harm is the most common. Many insurance companies call a coverage based on the date in which the claim is made a <span class="e_-_emphasis">Claims Made</span> coverage. (<span class="e_-_emphasis">Professional Malpractice Liability</span> or <span class="e_-_emphasis">Directors and Officers Liability</span> occasionally makes use of this type of coverage.)</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1211143">cycle</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211144">A container for either an agency bill statement or promise that is usually generated monthly for agency bill producers.</a></div>
