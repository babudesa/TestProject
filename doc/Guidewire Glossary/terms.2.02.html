      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051553">AB</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068591">The product code for Guidewire ContactCenter.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068590">ability to pay</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113057">A policy with the appropriate coverage at a high enough level to pay a claim against it has the </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">ability to pay</span>. ClaimCenter checks the coverage limits on the policy before setting or increasing reserves, or before making any new payment. This ensures that the policy has the ability to pay the entire reserve amount or that the sum of payments does not exceed the coverage limit on the policy.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051555">ab initio</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068595">A term used to describe avoidance of a contract from its inception or its beginning. The </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">Insurance Contracts Act</span> (U.S) allows an insurer to avoid a policy <span class="e_-_emphasis">ab initio</span> in situations in which an insured fraudulently non-disclosed or fraudulently misrepresented information during the application process.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1114358">abort</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1114359">A failure of a message that is one of several messages in an external operation, which causes the other messages in the external </a>operation to be skipped.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051557">account </a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1114413">(1) In PolicyCenter and BillingCenter, a higher level construct that logically groups multiple policies under a person or a com</a>pany, under one entity, <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Account</span>. For example, Acme Company account can include workers’ compensation and general liability policies, or a person can have both personal auto and homeowners policies. By tying both policies to the same account, the system tracks all of the business that the carrier has with a single insured. (2) Also in BillingCenter, an accounting record that accumulates the results of transactions. It shows increases, decreases, and a balance. See T-account.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069795">account current</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069796">An agency bill process that allows the producer to determine the due dates and the amounts to be paid. The producer is not sent </a>a monthly statement, but instead submits a <span class="e_-_emphasis">promise to pay</span> to the policy holder. This document lists the expected net amounts and the gross amount minus the commission amount. The promise to pay identifies the amount the producer expects to pay each month. If there is a discrepancy, BillingCenter generates an exception.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069807">account evaluation</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1069839">A process that automatically generates a rating of </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">Poor</span>, <span class="e_-_emphasis">Marginal</span>, <span class="e_-_emphasis">Acceptable</span>, <span class="e_-_emphasis">Good</span>, <span class="e_-_emphasis">Excellent</span>, or <span class="e_-_emphasis">New Account</span> for an account. BillingCenter bases the rating on certain criteria such as the number of delinquencies, perjorative payments or insufficient funds events, or policy cancellations. The carrier can use the account evaluation rating to help determine whether to renew the policy.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1069840">accounting year</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068634">Treaties that operate on an accounting year basis include all transactions that take place during the accounting year of the </a>treaty, regardless of the underwriting year to which they relate.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068633">accounts payable</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068262">Money that an insured owes to a carrier for products and services purchased on credit. This item appears on the insured’s bal</a>ance sheet as a current liability, as the expectation is that the liability must be fulfilled in less than a year. If you pay off accounts payable amounts, then it represents a negative cash flow for the company.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068261">accounts receivable</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068268">Money that an insured owes a carrier for products and services provided on credit. BillingCenter treats this money as a current </a>asset on a balance sheet. BillingCenter generally treats a specific service as an account receivable only after it sends the insured an invoice.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068267">acknowledgement</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051560">A message back to a Guidewire application indicating whether the message was successfully sent. This can be a positive </a>acknowledgement (<span class="cv_-_computer_voice">ack</span>) indicating that the external system processed the message. Or, it can also be a negative acknowledgement (<span class="cv_-_computer_voice">nack</span>) indicating that the external system did not handle the message properly because of some error.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121159">ACH</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211011">Automated clearing house. An electronic network of financial transactions in the United States that processes large volumes of </a>both credit and debit transactions, which are originated in batches.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1211004">ACR</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068647">Additional Case Reserves</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068639">action handler</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1159744">A parameter passed with HTTP data extraction requests. Action handlers specified in the URL do two things: provide different </a>extraction results, and provides the template with a different root object, or in some cases multiple root objects. For example, the <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">ViewClaim</span> action handler finds a specific claim then passes it to a template with the claim as the root object with the Gosu symbol claim.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1211897">active policy</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1211898">A policy that has not been canceled, not taken, expired, or non-renewed. </a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1211899">activity pattern</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1112999">A template that standardizes the way Guidewire applications generate activities. Both Gosu classes and ClaimCenter create </a>activities based on activity patterns. Each pattern describes one kind of activity that might be needed in handling the policy or account process. Activity patterns contain many default, or typical, characteristics for each activity, such as its name, its relative priority, and whether or not it is mandatory. When you create an activity, Guidewire applications use the pattern as a template to set the default values for the activity, such as <span class="e_-_emphasis">Subject</span> and <span class="e_-_emphasis">Priority</span>. You can override these defaults.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067561">adapter</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051564">The obsolete name used for a special type of plugin that Guidewire no longer supports. Some plugin interfaces have </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">adapter</span> in the name for historical reasons. However, this merely indicate that the object is a <span class="e_-_emphasis">plugin interface</span>. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051565">addendum</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068656">A document recording an alteration to a reinsurance contract.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068655">additional insured</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067570">A person or entity, other than the named insured, who the policy also affords some protection. The additional insured’s protec</a>tion is limited to liability incurred by the specific role they occupy in relation to the named insured. For example, the additional insured may receive protection as a landlord, an architect working for the insured, or as a leasing company. Additional insureds appear only in relation to liability type coverages.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121175">additional interest</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1121176">Additional interests appear only in relation to property type coverages. In general, they have a financial interest in a particular </a>piece of property. For example, an additional interest may be a mortgagor on a building or a lien holder on a vehicle. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1067567">additional perils</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068662">Sometimes called </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">Special Perils</span>, these may include losses caused by aircraft, explosion, earthquake, storm, tempest, flood, burst water pipes, riot, strike, civil commotion, or malicious damage. These are extensions that widen the scope of a basic insurance policy. Similar extensions may be available for other classes of insurance. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068661">additional premium</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068293">Any premium due to an insurer on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium. Typically, this is a result of </a>increased coverage, increased rates, retrospective rate calculations, or a premium audit.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068294">adjustable premium </a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068295">A premium that can vary. An insurer retains the right to change the premium or premium rate structure on a class of insureds </a>or business during the year. If it does so, then typically, it applies new rates to the new renewal policies.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068273">adjuster</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068671">A person who investigates and assesses claims on behalf of insurers. However, some policyholders can decide to appoint their </a>own loss adjuster to assist them in making a claim. If used in connection with marine insurance, then the term means one who investigates and apportions general average losses on behalf of ship owners (an average adjuster).</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068670">agent</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1066135">A person holding an agency agreement with an insurer and who, for reward, carries on the business of arranging contracts of </a>insurance as agent for one or more insurers. This agent is an <span class="e_-_emphasis">Authorized Representative</span>. Two types of agents sell insurance: <span class="e_-_emphasis">independent</span> agents, and <span class="e_-_emphasis">exclusive</span> or <span class="e_-_emphasis">captive</span> agents. Independent agents are self-employed, represent several insurance companies and are paid on commission. Exclusive or captive agents represent only one insurance company and can either work for a fixed salary or work on commission. An insurance company that uses exclusive or captive agents is a <span class="e_-_emphasis">direct writer</span>.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051567">agency bill</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068303">The billing method used by BillingCenter in which BillingCenter bills the producer for any charges instead of the insured. The </a>producer then bills the insured and makes payments to the carrier on an agreed-upon schedule. The structure combines multiple policies for billing purposes onto one producer statement that indicates amounts to be paid, minus the commission amounts. The producer completes a statement of insurance premiums due and sends it to the policyholder. The producer transmits the premium payment (minus commission) to the carrier on one of three bases: <span class="e_-_emphasis">item basis</span>, <span class="e_-_emphasis">statement basis</span>, or <span class="e_-_emphasis">account </span><span class="e_-_emphasis">current basis</span>.</div>

      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068687">A term used to describe the recalculation of prior years’ loss experience. It describes what the underwriting results of a pro</a>posed contract would have been if that contract had been in force during the period in question.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068686">asset</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068309">Balance sheet accounts representing things of value held by the business, including cash, accounts receivable, furniture and </a>fixtures.

      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068308">assignment engine</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051572">The Assignment engine handles assignment of business objects to users (claims and activities, for example) by repeatedly ask</a>ing the Rule engine to evaluate assignment rules for the item. Guidewire structures the base configuration assignment rule sets in a hierarchical fashion. As the Assignment engine works through assigning an entity, the assignment rules can assign the entity first to a location (a particular regional office, for example). It then assigns the entity to a specific group at that office. Finally, it assigns the entity to a specific person within the group.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051573">audit</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1116743">Insurers commonly review the financial records of their commercial insureds. This is to determine premiums for business </a>interruption, workers' compensation, manufacturing, contracting, product liability, and other risks in which the insurer bases premiums upon payroll, gross receipts, and other factors. Auditors (employees of the insurer or independent contractors) survey insured businesses' records to determine premiums due, based upon expenses and conditions stated in the policy. Typically, companies perform audits annually, after the policy period in question expires, and after the company considers the audited items to be final. If the audit determines that an insured's initial premium is too low (such as the estimates for audited exposures were lower than actuals), the audit results in an additional premium. If the audit shows that the initial premium was too high, then the company returns the excess part of the premium to the insured.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121227">authentication service plugin</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1121228">Plugin that authenticates a username and password against a remote authentication system. Guidewire provides a default </a>implementation that checks user authentication data against the ClaimCenter database. However, you can create a custom implementation to use other authentication services such as LDAP directories, for example.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121225">authentication source creator plugin</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1113142">Plugin that defines the logic for retrieving user login information from an HTTP request and putting it into a structured creden</a>tial called an Authentication Source. The plugin then returns this to Guidewire ClaimCenter. Guidewire provides a default implementation of this plugin that decodes the username and password information sent in a login form. However, Guidewire recommends that you create a custom implementations of this plugin if you want other forms of authentication, such as client certificates or a single sign-on (SSO) credential.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051577">Axis</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051578">A free implementation of the SOAP protocol. ClaimCenter uses the SOAP protocol behind the scenes to generate WSDL for </a>its APIs.
