      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067082">A specific risk or cause of loss covered by an insurance policy, such as a fire, windstorm, flood, or theft.

      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051787">plugin</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051788">Plugins are mini-programs that a Guidewire application invokes to perform an action or calculate a result. An example of a </a>plugin that calculates a result is a claim generation plugin, which returns a new claim number. An example of a plugin that performs an action is a messaging plugin, the purpose of which is to send a message to an external system. It is possible to implement a plugin in either Gosu or in Java.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051789">policy</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067125">A written contract for insurance between an insurance company and policyholder stating details of coverage. The policy </a>defines what items or risks are being covered, what set of coverages has been purchased, and the time period of coverage. For example, a personal auto policy lists a set of vehicles and covered drivers. It also lists a set of coverages for: collision, comprehensive, towing, rental car, uninsured/under-insured motorist, medical payments, and liability. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1115327">A policy protects the insured from accidental loss (not intentional actions, except for </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">Surety</span>, which is not strictly insurance at all). For liability coverages, this means that the policy insures against <span class="e_-_emphasis">negligence</span> (legal term) but not <span class="e_-_emphasis">malice</span>. Each policy type provides a set of coverages, which protect against specific types of losses and set limits and deductibles. The policy also lists the people or property to be insured against loss. <span class="e_-_emphasis">The structure of the policy data model varies among Guidewire applications.</span></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051792">Policy (entity)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051793">In PolicyCenter, this refers to all versions of a single policy over multiple policy periods. For example, each time that you </a>change an automobile policy, perhaps by adding a new driver or vehicle, PolicyCenter creates a new <span class="e_-_emphasis">version</span> of the policy. However, there is still only a single <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">Policy</span> entity for the policy.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051794">Policy Administration System (PAS)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068115">Computer systems that contain the policies and all their histories. They can vary in their breadth of functionality, but generally </a>share certain characteristics. These include tracking policy data, managing different policy versions, handling LOB variations, ties to billing systems, and meeting statutory reporting, notifications and regulatory requirements.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212925">policy equity</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212932">The difference between the paid amount and the earned premium as of a given date.</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1068112">policyholder</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051795">The person or business entity that forms a contract with the carrier to insure risks. Typically, the policyholder is protecting </a>himself from losses to owned property, people, or liability for other people's losses.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051797">PolicyPeriod (entity)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1051798">A policy can have multiple policy periods. A policy period represents a single contract period within a policy. For example, </a>every time that you renew a policy, PolicyCenter creates a new contract covering the new time period. This action creates a a new policy period. The policy period and its children (for example, Audit Schedule Items) represent data that describes the entire policy period, not just a single version of the policy. </div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121962">preemption</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1122139">The situation that arises when two concurrent PolicyCenter changes are based on the same branch. When the second one fin</a>ishes, you must merge changes from recently-bound jobs into the active job before binding the active job.</div>

      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1070411">Allows you to manage this billing process where insureds provide periodic reports to their Policy Administration System </a>(PAS) that detail their actual exposure which tends to changes over time.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121199">primary named insured</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1121212">The name which appears as the policyholder on the declarations page. The primary named insured is the </a><span class="e_-_emphasis">first named insured</span> in the policy contract and receives the policy contract, notifications, and other documentation. Other named insureds may be defined for a policy. The primary named insured represents all named insureds with regard to contract requirements, contract changes or termination. However, other named insureds are equally insured under the policy provisions. See <span class="e_-_emphasis">named insured.</span></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1121197">producer</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1212184">This is a generic term for any third party who brings business to the carrier. Except in the case of captive agents, the client rela</a>tionship is <span class="e_-_emphasis">owned</span> by the producer. Carriers pay commissions to the producer for bringing in new business and getting the clients to renew their policies. Carriers compete for the business through the producers, so both price and service to end clients and service and compensation to the producers matters. In BillingCenter, producers can participate in either <a href="javascript:WWHClickedPopup('glossary', 'terms.2.02.html#1051567', '');" title="A">agency bill</a> or <a href="javascript:WWHClickedPopup('glossary', 'terms.2.05.html#1070027', '');" title="D">direct bill</a> processes (or both).</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1212181">producer code</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1068505">The policy administration system (PAS) can generate a set of codes, and assign one or more of these codes to each agent or </a>broker with which the carrier does business. This code is the key to transacting business with producers. For example, the terms of the contract with the producer, and the payments made to the producer are all structured with producer codes. In BillingCenter, the producer code associates a producer with a commission plan.</div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1070379">producer payment</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1070391">Payments to producers that include outgoing payments for commissions that can be processed either manually or automati</a>cally.</div>

      <div class="zGlossary_Term"><a name="1051806">property / casualty insurance (P&amp;C)</a></div>
      <div class="zGlossary_Body"><a name="1067161">Covers damage to or loss of policyholdersâ€™ property and legal liability for damages caused to other people or their property. </a>Property/casualty insurance, which includes auto, homeowners, and commercial insurance, is one segment of the insurance industry. The other sector is life/health. Outside the United States, property/casualty insurance is referred to as nonlife or general insurance.

All entities have a public ID if they are identified in the applicationâ€™s Data Dictionary with the <span class="cv_-_computer_voice">keyable</span> attribute. Public IDs must be unique for that type of entity, but different entities can share the same public ID without problem. See also <span class="e_-_emphasis">reference type.</span></div>
